============

[dashDB](http://dashdb.com "dashDB - DWaaS") is a Data-Warehouse-as-a-Service (DWaaS) offering by IBM, available on [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net "IBM Bluemix"). It offers data storage with in-memory analytics and related tools. I am going to collect some related links here.

* The official dashDB website is http://dashdb.com
* Documentation for dashDB on Bluemix is available at https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/dashDB/index.html
* I have discussed dashDB and its predecessor, the IBM Analytics Warehouse, in my [blog](http://blog.4loeser.net "Data Henrik"). Some entries are:
